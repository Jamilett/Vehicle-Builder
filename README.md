## Description

Vehicle Management CLI is a TypeScript-based application for creating, managing, and performing actions on different types of vehicles directly from the command line. Users can create cars, trucks, and motorbikes, each with custom properties, and then perform various actions on these vehicles, such as starting, accelerating, towing (for trucks), and performing a wheelie (for motorbikes).
